# KiCad Tutorial Projects

These are two projects from the KiCad Like a Pro tutorial by Peter Dalmaris, who allowed me to try out the course for free. I think it's a really solid introduction to the tool for first time users of KiCad, which can be a difficult and confusing program for users coming from Eagle, DesignSpark, or Altium. 

The course won't turn you into a pro, but it does walk through pretty much everything you need to get started. There are some places where best practices of schematic and layout design are sacrificed but generally that's to point out a particular bug or tricky technique in KiCad. 

This course is especially appropriate for users who are new to PCB design in general, since he takes care to draw the designs back to the manufacturing process. If you've been doing Arduino breadboard projects, this course would get you comfortable with the tool through two through-hole and one surface mount project. I could definitely see a new user going on to design a custom Arduino shield next.

I would suggest keeping a notebook handy while you work through the course, and make note of any questions about ways to make the process more simple. KiCad is a free, open source tool under active development so it turned out many of the minor things that annoyed me have been solved. It just takes a quick check on Google. 

I was able to use the course to smooth out my KiCad workflow and make the transition from Eagle. I recommend it. Plus, you'll get three working project boards out of it. You can see the course over at <a href="txplore.tv/courses/kicad-pro">KiCad Like a Pro</a> at Tech Explorations.
