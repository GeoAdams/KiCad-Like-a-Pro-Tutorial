# KiCad Tutorial Projects

These are two projects from the KiCad Like a Pro tutorial by Peter Dalmaris, who allowed me to give it a try for free in return for feedback. I think it's a good class for first time users of KiCad, which can be a difficult and confusing program when coming from Eagle, DesignSpark, or Altium. The course does occasionally sacrifice some best practices in design but usually that's because those best practices might bog down and overwhelm the user. 

I was able to use the course to smooth out my KiCad workflow and make the transition from Eagle. I recommend it. Plus, you'll get three working project boards out of it.
